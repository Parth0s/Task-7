# Task 7: Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions

## 🔍 Objective
To review and manage browser extensions, identifying any unnecessary or potentially harmful ones, and improve browser security.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Opened Chrome's extension manager using `chrome://extensions`
- Reviewed all currently installed extensions
- Removed the “Dark Theme – Dark mode for web” extension due to poor functionality and no benefit

## 🛡️ What I Learned
- Some extensions serve no real use and can negatively impact user experience
- It's important to routinely audit browser extensions and check:
  - Permissions
  - Developer trustworthiness
  - User reviews

## 🗑️ Extension Removed
- **Dark Theme – Dark mode for web**: 
  - Inverts all websites regardless of original theme
  - Breaks the appearance of already-dark websites
  - Removed due to ineffectiveness

## 📸 Screenshots
- Included before and after removal screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder

## 📝 Notes
